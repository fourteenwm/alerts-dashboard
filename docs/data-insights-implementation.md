# Data Insights Page Implementation

## Overview

The Data Insights page has been successfully implemented according to the PRD requirements. This page provides an interactive workspace for users to explore, analyze, and generate AI-powered insights from their advertising data.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Source Selection
- Dropdown menu to select from available data sources
- Automatically populates with available data tabs
- Default selection of first available data source
- Dynamic column derivation based on selected data

### 2. Column Management
- Automatic column type detection (metric, dimension, date)
- User-friendly display names (e.g., "Ad Group ID" instead of "adGroupId")
- Type-aware filtering and formatting

### 3. Data Preview Table
- Configurable row count (5, 10, 30, 50, 100 rows)
- Sortable columns with visual indicators
- Proper data formatting based on column types
- Empty state handling

### 4. Advanced Filtering System
- Dynamic filter creation with "Add Filter" button
- Type-aware operator selection:
  - **Text/Dimension**: contains, does not contain, equals, not equals, starts with, ends with
  - **Numeric/Metric**: equals, not equals, greater than, less than, greater than or equals, less than or equals
  - **Date**: equals, not equals, after, before, on or after, on or before
- AND logic for multiple filters
- Individual filter removal
- Clear all filters functionality

### 5. Data Summary Section
- Total row count display
- Metric columns: min, max, average, sum calculations
- Dimension columns: unique value counts
- Top values for dimensions (when applicable)

### 6. AI Insights Generation
- Support for multiple LLM providers:
  - Gemini Pro
  - OpenAI GPT-4
  - Anthropic Claude 3
- Natural language prompt input
- Context-aware data analysis
- Token usage tracking
- Error handling and loading states

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **Types** (`src/lib/types.ts`)
   - Added comprehensive type definitions for Data Insights
   - Column types, filter conditions, data summaries
   - LLM provider types and response interfaces

2. **API Route** (`src/app/api/insights/route.ts`)
   - RESTful endpoint for AI insights generation
   - Provider-agnostic architecture
   - Mock implementations for all LLM providers
   - Data size limiting for API efficiency

3. **Custom Hook** (`src/hooks/useDataInsights.ts`)
   - Centralized state management
   - Data filtering and sorting logic
   - Column derivation and type inference
   - AI insights generation orchestration

4. **Main Page** (`src/app/data-insights/page.tsx`)
   - Responsive layout with left controls, right data display
   - Real-time data updates
   - Intuitive user interface
   - Error handling and loading states

5. **UI Components**
   - Created `Textarea` component (`src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`)
   - Updated Navigation to include Data Insights link

6. **Context Updates** (`src/lib/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx`)
   - Added `useDataStore` hook for data access
   - Integrated with existing data fetching

### Key Technical Features

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive type definitions
- **Performance**: Efficient data processing with useMemo and useCallback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper breakpoints
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling throughout the application
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new LLM providers or data sources

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select Data Source**: Choose from available data tabs in the dropdown
2. **Apply Filters**: Add filters to refine your data view using the filter controls
3. **Review Summary**: Check the data summary for statistical overview
4. **Explore Data**: Use the preview table to examine filtered data
5. **Generate Insights**: Enter a question and select an AI model to generate insights

## Future Enhancements

The implementation is designed to be easily extensible for future features:

- Real LLM API integrations (currently using mock responses)
- Saved filter configurations
- Export functionality
- Advanced visualizations
- User preference storage
- Batch processing for large datasets

## API Integration Notes

The current implementation includes mock responses for all LLM providers. To integrate with real APIs:

1. Replace mock functions in `src/app/api/insights/route.ts`
2. Add API keys to environment variables
3. Implement proper error handling for API limits
4. Add rate limiting and caching as needed

## Performance Considerations

- Data is processed client-side for immediate feedback
- Large datasets are limited to 1000 rows for AI analysis
- Efficient filtering and sorting algorithms
- Memoized calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
